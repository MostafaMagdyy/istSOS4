# Living Labs (LL)

## The LLs will create a common space for discussion where stakeholders with different profiles can exchange points of view and experiences. Each LL will be led by a project partner. Thanks to these LLs, the communities will be actively engaged in the design, application and review of the solution to guarantee that the implemented ICT tools will reflect final user needs and requirements of all the parties.

The planned LL meetings are:

- **LL Meeting 1**: project introduction and LL kick-off
- **LL Meeting 2**: co-analysis of requirements & co-definition of solution (a half day workshop for the conceptualization and design will be organized within the first three months of the project).
- **LL Meeting 3**: handle spatio-temporal datasets using FAIR & replicable web services (tutorials and exercises with related dataset)
- **LL Meeting 4**: identification of KPI for User Acceptance Testing (demonstrating the implemented OSIReS solution in real-cases using data from the three LLs)
- **LL Meeting 5**: exploitation and business model definition (analyze our implementation and provide a business model, formally establish an Open Community)
