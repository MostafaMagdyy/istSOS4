# Biodiversity Living Lab

A consortium of experts from different communities such as Infoflora, InfoFauna, BirdLife Svizzera, Ficedula association, Vogelwarte as well as local associations such as the “association de la grande Cariçaie'' will be contacted. HEIG-VD already has many contacts with members of these entities. In Ticino the FreshWater ecology research group in SUPSI will be engaged. UNIGE is also in contact with the Federal Office for the Environment (Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland - BDM), as well as the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest Snow and Landscape Research (WSL).
