Welcome to the istSOS4 tutorial! istSOS4 is an open-source Sensor Things API (STA)) implementation that allows users to manage and publish observations from various sensors. It is designed to be compliant with the OGC STA standard, making it easy to integrate with other geospatial services and applications.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:


- [istSOS4 works and its principles](tutorial/intro.md)
- [Install and configure istSOS4](link_to_installation)
- [Use the Sensor Things API to create and manage Datastreams](link_to_sensor_things_api)
- [Use the Sensor Things API to insert and retrieve Observations](link_to_sensor_things_api_things)
- [Manage Authentication & Authorization](link_to_autorization)
- [Exploit the Traveltime extension to support reproducibility and data lineage](link_to_traveltime_extension)
- [Apply advanced filtering to retrieve data](link_to_sensor_things_api_advanced)
- [Leverage Python for Data curation and quality assurance](link_to_data_cleaning)
- [Apply ML & AI data processing to time series](link_to_data_manipulation)

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to use istSOS4 to manage and exploit your sensor data effectively.

Let's get started!
