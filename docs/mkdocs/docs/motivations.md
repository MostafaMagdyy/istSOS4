Digital technologies are offering to researchers the opportunity to access big spatio-temporaldata that enable the application of modern technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Internet ofThings, Machine Learning, etc.) to study and model phenomena evolution and elaborate effective solutions to support coping with a number of very relevant societal issues [1] [@test].

Spatio-temporal data are characterised by being composed of three main components: thespatial attributes, the temporal attributes and the contextual attributes [2]. Spatio-temporal datatypes vary by the possible combination of these three components, for example: trajectories arediscrete point locations of an element with associated timestamp, sensor observations arevarying attributes with time in a specific location, satellite data are raster images varying intime, cadaster data are polygons which vary its geometry in time. In modern Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) like swisstopo or INSPIRE infrastructures, thesespatio-temporal data are very often available using interoperable Web services capable toaddress the challenges of enabling discovery access and usage, provide real-time data toreal-time applications and support scalable solutions to cope with high concurrent users accessto offer high quality services [3]. These data are very often used to conduct research onspace/time-varying phenomena, on different topics like for example smart cities [4, 5, 6],biodiversity [7, 8, 9] and climate change [10, 11, 12, 13]. In most cases these SDI, involvingdata from any sectors and scientific community, are based on the standard data models andinteroperable data services defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and theInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO), both for the upstream (data insertion,pre-processing) and downstream (application, analytics) services. These standards mostlycomply with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles [14] despitesome challenges in terms of poor usage of Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and poor use ofdocumented and resolvable persistent vocabulary [15]. Additionally, recently a new family ofOGC standards, based on the OpenAPI specifications, are being implemented to facilitate theintegration of geospatial data into modern web applications and systems [16].Nevertheless, none of these standards currently offer any feature to access a dataset to itsprevious state at a specific instant in time. Without this key feature (time versioning)reproducibility of any research based on these data services cannot be guaranteed since it isnot possible to reference, identify and extract the offered dataset as it was at the time of thestudy. While in minor cases the extraction and storage in a permanent and immutable datarepository (e.g.: Zenodo) of the entire dataset might be a solution, in most of the cases theduplication of very large dataset is not possible (the service do not allow to download the entiredataset) and not suggested (duplication of large dataset requires large space and came withhigh costs). Finally, even if extracted in a data repository the functioning of executable papersbased on these standards and Web services may not be assured.With the proposed project the participants, already jointly working on these standards incollaboration with several national and international communities, propose to:1.2.3.Engage with several communities and stakeholders to identify requirements andpossible solutions while promoting the usage of interoperable solutions.Propose standard extensions and best practices to cope with reproducibility in termsof access to versioned data for further adoption and implementation.Set up a containerized solution (based on most reliable open source technologies) todeploy a replicable and interoperable Open Research Spatio-temporal Datarepository to demonstrate the proposed solution.
